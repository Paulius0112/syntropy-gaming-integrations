# Syntropy Gaming Integrations

This repository contains use-cases of how Syntropy can be integrated into the gaming world. Here you will find examples of how you can use the Syntropy Platform and its stack to automate secure connections between your players and servers.

We are continually updating this repository with new use-cases.

## Syntropy Stack for Gaming

The Syntropy Stack focuses on autonomous horizontal scaling. Through Syntropy’s API & SDK, a network can be automatically created whenever one is needed. Take Minecraft, for example. If a user challenges another user to a battle, an API call facilitated with a Discord Bot to the Syntropy network can create a network, and connect N number of players to the network through the Syntropy Agent on each player’s machine. 

It is a flexible solution that encrypts traffic through all the connections made within a network by using Wireguard tunnelling. Encryption protocols such as Wireguard would dispel would-be attackers who would not be able to mount a hack, even on a machine within their network. Syntropy gives organizers the tools needed to design their own secure networks and determine the relationships between connections.

## Syntropy Builders

This repository is part of a [Syntropy Builders program](https://www.syntropystack.com/build).

Syntropy Builders is a community enablement program for our most dedicated developer contributors. The program takes place in established working groups led by Syntropy’s developers and engineers.

We are open for your contributions to new gaming integrations and use cases. Let’s talk on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NVjTeRGqKb).
